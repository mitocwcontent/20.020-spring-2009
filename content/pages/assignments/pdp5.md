First, reconsider the challenges and opportunities that were presented in today's studio ([Week #3]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-and-studio-notes/wk03#Studio_3:_Sorting_Hat_into_Project_Camps)).

Then select your 3 favorite project ideas as well as your first and second choice for a camp assignment to your counselors. Next week, you'll be assigned a team and, as a team, you'll get started on 3 ideas in your area of interest.
